## Short description

Was Da Vinci born in Florence?
Does patient 'Johnson' really have 300 heart-beats
per minute?
Checking the accuracy of facts is vital,
for question answering, data cleaning,
anomaly detection, fraud detection, and more.

Here we present three families of fact-checking
approaches, based on the domains to which they apply:
(a) \textit{text} documents (b) \textit{graphs} and \textit{knowledge bases}
and (c) \textit{relational} databases.
The emphasis is on the intuition behind each method,
as well as on a practitioner's guide, 
highlighting the applicability of each method to each setting.
